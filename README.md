# Laboratory work â„–5. Design patterns
In this laboratory work I implemented 3 design patterns:
 - Builder. Builder was added to Patient, Ward, Department, Hospital and Filter classes.
 - Factory. Factory was added ParserType class where we get DOM or SAX parsers depending on passed parser name.
 - Chain of responsibilities. Chain of responsibilities was added for patient filters. There are 3 types of filters: bu age, by covis status and insuranse.
